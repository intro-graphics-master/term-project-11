## Introduction


## Advance Topics
- SCSS set up
- npm configuation
- Webpack configuation
- Three.js library
- Canvas adjustment
- Display port real-time self adjustment

- Perlin Noise
- Diamond Square Algorithm
- GUI user interactive control



## Difficulties
**Setting up the environment for three.js, npm, and web package**  
    Even though we decide to use three.js, it is hard to set up the environment for three.js.

## Reference
- Sky: https://threejs.org/examples/?q=sky#webgl_shaders_sky  
This explains how to use sky library inside three.js.  
- Water: https://threejs.org/examples/?q=ocean#webgl_shaders_ocean  
This explains how to use sky library inside three.js.  
- Terrain: https://threejs.org/examples/webgl_geometry_terrain.html
This gives us the actual idea of how to implement Perlin Noise and Diamond Square Algorithm
